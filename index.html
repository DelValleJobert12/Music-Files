    <h1> Lyrics: Borrowed Time by Cueshe</h1>
    <p>
        Every fight needs mending<br>
        Every start has an end<br>
        Like the sunrise and the sunset<br>
        That's just how it is<br>
        </br>
        Love on borrowed time<br>
        Will never be yours nor mine<br>
        I need you like you need me<br>
        The way we ought to be<br>
        </br>
        Oh, it's good to be true,<br>
        If our hopes and dreams come true<br>
        Wish that I had more<br>
        Of this borrowed time<br>
        If only it would last a lifetime.<br>
        </br>
        This bitterness inside<br>
        Is an empty space I hide<br>
        It never satisfies<br>
        Living my life in a lie<br>
        </br>
        Love on borrowed time<br>
        Will never be yours nor mine<br>
        I'll just close my eyes<br>
        And it will be alright<br>
        </br>
        Oh, it's good to be true,<br>
        If our hopes and dreams come true<br>
        Wish that I had more<br>
        Of this borrowed time<br>
        If only it would last a lifetime.<br>
        </br>
        Now that you've gone away<br>
        You seem so close<br>
        But you're miles and miles away<br>
        </br>
        Oh, it's good to be true,<br>
        If our hopes and dreams come true<br>
        Wish that I had more<br>
        Of this borrowed time<br>
        If only it would last.<br>
        Oh, it's good to be true,<br>
        If our hopes and dreams come true<br>
        Wish that I had more<br>
        Of this borrowed time<br>
        If only it would last.<br>
        Oh, it's good to be true,<br>
        If our hopes and dreams come true<br>
        Wish that I had more<br>
        Of this borrowed time<br>
        If only it would last a lifetime.<br>
    </p>
